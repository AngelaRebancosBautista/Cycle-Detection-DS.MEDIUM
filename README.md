# Cycle-Detection-DS.MEDIUM

This C# program detects if a singly linked list contains a cycle using Floydâ€™s Cycle-Finding Algorithm (slow and fast pointers). It builds the list from input, optionally links the tail back to an earlier node to form a cycle, and outputs 1 if a cycle exists or 0 if not.
